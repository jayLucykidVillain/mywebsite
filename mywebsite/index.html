            <p>
              Hey! While my name's initials are 'JC', I was born and raised in
              Chicago. I currently work at an Amazon Fulfillment Center (MDW9)
              where I've been for almost 4 years now this October. I have
              too many interests ranging from gaming, music, art, philosophy, TV
              & film, pop culture, figure collecting, the guitar and more. There
              are many places I would love to travel to, but my number one at
              the top of the list is definitely Japan, especially to do a tour
              of
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido" target="_blank">Hokkaido</a>. Check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaime-l-cueto/" target="_blank">my LinkedIn </a>if you want to know more.

              <p>But I'm definitely excited to share the progress that I make to
              this site, and all the design and layout upgrades that are to
              come! Look forward to it!

            <p>
              I've always liked solving problems and using my head, so it makes
              sense that I'd be attracted to coding and web development. I
              learned a little bit of HTML back when I was in high school, but
              that was ages ago. In just a few short weeks with the Correlation
              One program, I've learned how to make a basic web page that
              includes forms, tables, links to other sites, images, videos, etc.
              I understand how useful and essential CSS can be in making the
              appearance of a site go from 0 to 100 real fast.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              While overall I have found everything interesting, I find the
              availability of free resources for developers phenomenal. I
              particularly like using
              <a href="https://colorhunt.co/" target="_blank">colorhunt</a> as
              there are a variety of color palettes to use and a useful feature
              is that a certain color's hex code is instantly copied to the
              clipboard when clicked on! I'm also finding myself using the "view
              page source" feature on sites I visit often. I might not
              understand everything yet, but there are some things that stand
              out.
